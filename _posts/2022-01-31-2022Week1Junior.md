# Problem 2
An integer between $1000$ and $9999$, inclusive, is chosen at random. What is the probability that it is an odd integer whose digits are all distinct?

# Problem 3
It is known that $\sqrt{b}+c = \sqrt{10+2\sqrt{24}}$. If $b$ and $c$ are both integers, find the value of $(b+c)^2$.

# Problem 4
if $a+\frac{1}{b}=6, a^3+\frac{1}{b^3}=180$, find the value of $\frac{a}{b}$.
